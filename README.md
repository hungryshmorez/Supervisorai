## Problem statement

Autonomous agents fail in a specific, expensive way: they *lose the plot*. A
coding agent starts fixing a bug and quietly drifts into rewriting unrelated
files; a research assistant confidently cites a source that says the opposite of
what it claims; a multi-step task reports "done" while a dependency silently
failed. The missing piece is not a bigger worker model — it is a **supervisor**
that holds the plan, checks every step against it, and refuses to declare
success until the work actually verifies.

**SupervisorAI** is that supervisor. It uses MiniMax-M3's reasoning to run a
closed loop over a team of workers:

> **Plan → Delegate → Audit → Correct → (verified) Synthesis**

M3 decomposes a goal into a validated task DAG, delegates each task to an
M3-backed worker, then puts on its supervisor hat and audits every output
against the plan — catching hallucinations, errors, and drift. Failed or drifted
outputs are re-prompted with a concrete correction hint. Only when *every*
dependency passes verification does the system synthesize a final, verified
result. Every stage is streamed as a live, tagged execution trace.

                                              5. VERIFIED SYNTHESIS
```

The single integration point is **`src/llm/client.py` (`LLMClient`)** — every
LLM-using component (orchestrator decomposer, `LLMJudge`, `ResearchAssistor`)
depends on it, so retargeting this one class flips the whole platform onto
MiniMax-M3.

## Studio capabilities (agent roster · continuity · deliverables · HITL)

On top of the reasoning loop, SupervisorAI runs as an autonomous studio:

- **Specialist agent roster** — named worker personas live in `agents/*.json`
  (`coder.python`, `coder.javascript`, `writer.narrative`, `reviewer.code`, …).
  M3 assigns the best specialist to each task during planning, and each worker
  runs with its persona as its system prompt.
- **Continuity engine** — pass `continuity_rules` (era, character, tone, safety
  canon) to `run_goal`; they are injected into every worker prompt, folded into
  each audit's checks, and guarded by a fast deterministic pre-check. Violations
  trigger a self-healing correction.
- **On-disk deliverables** — every *verified* worker output is written to
  `deliverables/<file>` (with markdown-fence stripping, so `.html`/`.py`/`.json`
  are valid standalone files). A run produces real artifacts, not just text.
- **Human-in-the-Loop (Deep-Sleep) gate** — tasks the planner marks
  `high_stakes` (finalizing/packaging a shippable artifact) **halt** before they
  are written and require explicit human approval. Approve/deny via the
  `hitl_status` / `hitl_approve` / `hitl_deny` MCP tools (or an approval callback
  in code). **Never auto-approved** — the gate is the last line of defense.

> These four capabilities were consolidated from a sibling prototype (VORTEX-OS)
> onto this engine, so there is one verified system instead of two.

### The VORTEX-OS studio skills (`vortex-os/`, `vortex-os-v3/`)

The Python engine above grew out of **VORTEX-OS**, a bash "skill" that runs the
same 4-tier orchestration from the command line. Both flavors ship here, and both
now call **MiniMax-M3 on GMI Cloud** for real (via `lib/minimax.sh`) instead of
the placeholder stubs they were built with:

- **`vortex-os/`** — the creative studio flavor: 4-tier chain of command, HITL
  Deep-Sleep gate, continuity engine, self-healing, and real on-disk
  deliverables. Run `./skill.sh --dispatch-master <objective.md>`.
- **`vortex-os-v3/`** — the software-engineering flavor: a 30+ agent roster
  (coder.python, reviewer.code, security.sast, …) with dynamic agents, consensus
  voting, cost governance, and quality gates. A real `adapters/minimax_m3.sh`
  drives the adapter chain, and the rule-verdict / consensus steps call M3.

Set `GMI_API_KEY` (see `.env.example`) and each skill runs against real M3;
without a key both fall back to a deterministic offline mode so they never
hard-crash.

## GMI Cloud / MiniMax-M3 integration

| | |
|---|---|
| **Endpoint** | `https://api.gmi-serving.com/v1/messages` (Anthropic Messages-compatible) |
| **Base URL** | `https://api.gmi-serving.com/v1` (env `GMI_BASE_URL`) |
| **Model** | `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M3` (env `SUPERVISOR_MODEL`) |
| **Auth** | `x-api-key: $GMI_API_KEY` and `Authorization: Bearer $GMI_API_KEY` (both sent) |

`LLMClient` adds production concerns on top of the raw endpoint:
retry with exponential backoff (on 429/5xx/network), token-budget accounting,
robust structured-JSON extraction (handles ```json fences and embedded JSON),
tool-calling pass-through, SSE streaming, and a **graceful, context-aware mock
fallback** so the demo, tests, and MCP server never hard-crash when no key is
set.

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Install
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Configure your GMI key
cp .env.example .env      # then edit .env and paste your GMI_API_KEY
#   (or just:  export GMI_API_KEY="<your key>")

# 3. Run the turnkey demo — plan, delegate, audit, self-correct, verify
python demo.py

# 4. Run the test suite
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/ -q

# 5. (optional) Run the MCP server exposing the supervisor as tools
PYTHONPATH=src python src/server/main.py
```

The demo runs a real scenario — an incoming bug report on a mock repo — and
prints a live trace tagged `[SUPERVISOR - M3]`, `[DISPATCH]`, `[AUDIT]`,
`[DRIFT DETECTED]`, `[RECOVERY]`, `[SYNTHESIS]`, finishing with a verified PR
summary and a per-task audit ledger. With no `GMI_API_KEY` it still runs
end-to-end on a deterministic mock so you can see the loop before wiring a key.

> **Security note:** never commit your `GMI_API_KEY`. It belongs in `.env`
> (gitignored) only. Rotate any key that has been shared in plaintext.

## Project Overview

This project is a sophisticated, AI-powered system designed to supervise, manage, and assist other AI agents. It has evolved from a simple monitoring script into a multi-layered platform with advanced capabilities for intelligent oversight and autonomous operation.

The system is built around three core concepts:
*   **Supervision:** A supervisor agent that uses a probabilistic model (Expectimax) to watch over a working agent, predict potential issues, and intervene when necessary.
*   **Orchestration:** An autonomous orchestrator that can manage a pool of specialized agents, decompose high-level goals into a dependency graph of tasks, and manage the entire execution workflow, including delegating complex tasks to sub-orchestrators.
*   **Assistance:** A proactive research assistant that can detect when an agent is stuck, perform web searches to find solutions for its errors, and provide intelligent suggestions to help it recover.

## 2. Core Features

This project includes a rich set of features, demonstrating a robust and intelligent architecture.

### **Supervision Engine**

*   **Intelligent Supervisor Agent:**
    *   Uses an **Expectimax algorithm** (`supervisor_agent/expectimax_agent.py`) to make nuanced decisions about whether to `ALLOW`, `WARN`, `CORRECT`, or `ESCALATE` an agent's output. This is not based on simple rules, but on a probabilistic model of future outcomes.
    *   The decision-making is based on a weighted evaluation of the agent's state, including output quality, task drift, error count, and resource usage.

*   **Code-Aware Supervision:**
    *   The supervisor can now understand code quality. When an agent produces Python code, the system uses the **`pylint` static analysis tool** (`analysis/code_analyzer.py`) to check for errors, code smells, and style issues.
    *   The number of errors found is factored directly into the `AgentState` passed to the Expectimax agent, making its decisions about code much more intelligent.

*   **Multi-modal Supervision:**
    *   The supervisor now has a new sense: vision. It can evaluate image-based outputs from agents.
    *   When an agent's output is an image URL, the `LLMJudge` uses a vision-capable model (e.g., Claude 3 Opus) to evaluate the image against the task goals.

*   **Feedback-Driven Learning:**
    *   The supervisor can **learn from user feedback**. The dashboard allows a human to correct a bad decision, and this feedback is used to retrain the weights of the Expectimax agent's evaluation function via `supervisor_agent/feedback_trainer.py`.
    *   This creates a powerful self-improvement loop, allowing the supervisor's judgment to get better over time.

### **Orchestration Engine**

*   **Autonomous Orchestrator with Multi-LLM Support:**
    *   Manages a pool of specialized agents with different capabilities.
    *   Features an **LLM-powered task planner**. The system is architected to use multiple LLM providers concurrently (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI), loading its configuration from `config/llm_config.json`.
    *   Different models can be used for different tasks (e.g., a fast model for planning, a powerful model for judging) to optimize for cost and performance.

*   **Sub-Orchestration:**
    *   For extremely complex goals, the main orchestrator can now delegate tasks to **sub-projects**. The LLM planner is instructed to identify tasks that are themselves large projects and assign them a `sub_orchestration` capability.
    *   The orchestrator then creates a new, nested `ProjectGoal` and monitors it, allowing for hierarchical, recursive problem-solving.

*   **Resource-Aware Task Assignment:**
    *   The orchestrator is now aware of agent system resources. Agents can report their CPU and memory load via a new API endpoint.
    *   The `find_available_agent` logic has been enhanced to filter out agents with high resource usage (e.g., >90%) and to prioritize assigning tasks to the least-loaded agent available.

*   **The Agent Factory:**
    *   The system is capable of building new agents for itself. When a "build agent" goal is submitted, the orchestrator creates a sub-project to manage a team of coding agents that write, test, and register a new agent into the pool.

### **Assistance & UI**

*   **Proactive Research Assistant:**
    *   The supervisor can detect when an agent is "stuck". It then autonomously formulates a search query, uses **Google Search** to find relevant help articles, and uses an **LLM to synthesize a helpful suggestion**.

*   **Cost Analysis:**
    *   A `CostTracker` service logs every LLM call made by the system. It uses model-specific pricing to calculate the cost of each call and provides a detailed report, which can be viewed on the dashboard.

*   **Interactive Dashboard with Real-Time Updates:**
    *   A comprehensive web dashboard (`examples/dashboard.html`) serves as the central UI.
    *   The dashboard now features **real-time log and status streaming** via a dedicated WebSocket connection, making the UI highly responsive.
    *   It includes an **interactive debugger** that visualizes the Expectimax agent's entire decision tree as a flowchart.

## 3. System Architecture

The project is organized into a standard Python project structure:

*   `src/supervisor_agent/`: Contains the core `SupervisorCore` and the `ExpectimaxAgent`.
*   `src/orchestrator/`: Contains the `Orchestrator` and its data models.
*   `src/researcher/`: Contains the `ResearchAssistor`.
*   `src/analysis/`: Contains the `CodeQualityAnalyzer`.
*   `src/agent_factory/`: Contains templates for building new agents.
*   `src/llm/`: Contains the multi-LLM client architecture (`base.py`, `manager.py`, etc.).
*   `src/server/`: Contains the main ASGI server (`main.py`).
*   `examples/dashboard.html`: The all-in-one web interface.
*   `tests/`: Contains unit and integration tests.

## 4. Setup and Installation

To get the project running, follow these steps:

1.  **Set up a Python virtual environment:**
    *   This project uses Python's standard `venv` module.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```

2.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    *   Install all required packages using the `pip` from your new virtual environment.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure API Keys (Optional):**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory or set environment variables for the LLM providers you wish to use.
    ```
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-key"
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
    ```
    *   If API keys are not set, the relevant clients will return mocked responses.

## 5. How to Run the System

1.  **Start the Server:**
    *   The application is an ASGI web server and should be run with `uvicorn`. The following command also sets the `PYTHONPATH` correctly, which is required for the application's imports to work.
    ```bash
    PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/src .venv/bin/uvicorn src.server.main:mcp --port 8765
    ```
    *   You should see output from `uvicorn` indicating the server is running on `http://127.0.0.1:8765`.

2.  **Use the Dashboard:**
    *   Open the `examples/dashboard.html` file in your web browser. This file is self-contained and will connect to the local server automatically.

## 6. Future Roadmap

This project has a rich roadmap for future development.

### Planned Features
*   **Interactive Goal Definition:** Create a UI for drag-and-drop task planning.
*   **Authentication & Multi-User:** Add a proper user login system.

### Next Frontier Ideas
*   **The Ethics Guardian:** A specialized supervisor to enforce an "ethical constitution."
*   **The Self-Improving Supervisor (Meta-Learning):** A supervisor that learns from its own interventions to improve its policies.
*   **Predictive Intervention Engine:** A system that analyzes an agent's work in real-time to predict and prevent failures.
*   **Full System Autonomy:** Connect the orchestrator to external data streams to allow it to discover and propose its own goals.
*   **Meta-Supervision:** A system that can analyze its own performance and autonomously refactor its own source code or prompts.
*   **Human-AI Symbiosis:** Evolve the UI into a true collaborative partner with conversational planning and deeply explainable AI (XAI).
*   **Decentralized Swarm Orchestration:** Move from a single orchestrator to a decentralized swarm of orchestrators.
*   **Embodied AI & Physical World Control:** Connect the orchestrator to physical hardware (robotics, IoT).
